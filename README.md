# Pixelwise-Image-Segmentation
This problem  introduces pixel-wise image segmentation. The image segmentation problem is a core vision problem with a longstanding history of research. His- torically, this problem has been studied in the unsupervised setting as a clustering problem: given an image, produce a pixelwise prediction that segments the image into coherent clusters corresponding to objects in the image
